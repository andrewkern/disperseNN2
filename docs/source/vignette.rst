Vignette: example workflow
==========================

Snakefile? or bash commands like in disperseNN. Snakefile woudl help people out more I think. but then the training steps are awkward... And it's like. It's more complicated to describe the training command if it's wrapped in a snakefile.... But on the other hand, if they only need to type there params and file names once, in the config file, it coudl potentially be easier....

But most software does not rely on snakemake. Just give it the commands.

Yeah, do that, and separately provide a snakefile.
